<h2 id="weekly-5">Weekly 5</h2>
<h3 id="general-overview">General Overview:</h3>
<p>Throughout this week, I focused on various tasks within the scope of my internship. Here is the progress I have made:</p>
<h3 id="python-library-development">1. Python Library Development:</h3>
<p>I continued the development of a Python library for the patient tracking system. This library is designed to send HTTP GET and POST requests to <a href="http://webhook.site">webhook.site</a> via a modem. I fixed and rewrote the existing code, enabling successful communication through HTTP GET and POST requests.</p>
<h3 id="sending-requests-over-the-modem">2. Sending Requests Over the Modem:</h3>
<p>With the modifications made to the library, HTTP GET and POST requests can now be smoothly sent from the modem to [webhook.site]. This is a crucial step towards ensuring robust data exchange in our patient tracking system.</p>
<h3 id="sending-mqtt-messages">3. Sending MQTT Messages:</h3>
<p>Additionally, I continued my work on an example code that sends MQTT messages on <a href="https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt/public-mqtt-broker/">HiveMQ</a>. The MQTT protocol provides an effective solution for data transmission.</p>
<h3 id="detailed-progress">Detailed Progress:</h3>
<h4 id="a.-python-library-development">a. Python Library Development:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Analyzed the existing code and identified problematic areas.</li>
<li>Rectified the code and established a modular structure.</li>
<li>Successfully integrated HTTP GET and POST requests.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b.-sending-requests-over-the-modem">b. Sending Requests Over the Modem:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Verified that successful requests are sent from the modem to [webhook.site] after the library modifications.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c.-sending-mqtt-messages">c. Sending MQTT Messages:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wrote sample code for sending MQTT messages on <a href="https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt/public-mqtt-broker/">HiveMQ</a>.</li>
<li>Aiming to successfully send messages via MQTT.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="future-goals">Future Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete and test the process of sending MQTT messages.</li>
<li>Take more detailed notes on daily progress and encountered challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sharing my progress and tasks accomplished during this week. I plan to achieve further developments in line with my upcoming goals.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
