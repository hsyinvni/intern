<h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Raspberry Pi 3 OS Reinstallation:</strong><br>
This week, I started by reinstalling the Raspberry Pi 3 with the Raspberry Pi OS, ensuring that the device operates with the latest and healthiest version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Python Learning:</strong><br>
I delved into learning the Python programming language in detail. I focused on understanding the fundamental syntax, basic functions, methods, and functions. I put effort into improving my foundational skills in the Python language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protocol Research:</strong><br>
I conducted research on PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), QMI (Qualcomm MSM Interface), and RMNET (Raw Mobile Network Enhanced Throughput) protocols. PPP is an network communication protocol used for communication between computers over serial connections. QMI and RMNET are crucial protocols used for data transmission between mobile devices. Through these research activities, I gained insights into the fundamental features of these protocols.</p>
