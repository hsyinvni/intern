<p>Additionally, I completed my work on establishing a connection with the PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) protocol. The connection was successfully established, and a ping was successfully sent to <a href="http://sixfab.com">sixfab.com</a> over this connection. This step was crucial to verify internet access and its successful completion marked a positive progress for the project.</p>
