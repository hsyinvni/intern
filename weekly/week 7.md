<h2 id="work-on-mqtt-message-sending-code">Work on MQTT Message Sending Code</h2>
<p>This week, I worked on the code for sending MQTT messages. However, I encountered an error message while trying to run the code. I took various steps to resolve the issue, but unfortunately, I was not successful.</p>
<h2 id="connection-work-with-ppp-protocol">Connection Work with PPP Protocol</h2>
<h3 id="ppp-point-to-point-protocol">PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)</h3>
<p>Connection was established with the PPP protocol, and the connection speed was measured.</p>
<p><img src="https://r.resimlink.com/n9A7F6QUwPi.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>PPP is commonly used for serial data transmission between computers. It can be used in various communication environments such as dial-up connections, DSL, and serial line connections.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection establishment</li>
<li>Transmission of data frames</li>
<li>Network layer protocol independence</li>
<li>Security</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="work-with-qmi-protocol">Work with QMI Protocol</h2>
<h3 id="qmi-qualcomm-msm-interface">QMI (Qualcomm MSM Interface)</h3>
<p>QMI is a communication interface protocol for mobile devices. It is used in devices with Qualcomm chipsets to manage data transmission over 3G, 4G, and 5G mobile networks.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modular structure</li>
<li>Support for mobile broadband connections</li>
<li>Network management tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Connection was established with the QMI protocol, and speed measurement was performed.<br>
