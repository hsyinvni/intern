<h1 id="weekly-report---week3">Weekly Report - week3</h1>
<h2 id="general-overview">General Overview</h2>
<p>This week, efforts were made on writing a Python library. An example code sending HTTP GET and POST requests over a modem was written. However, due to hardware errors, these codes could not be tested. Testing continues on these examples.</p>
